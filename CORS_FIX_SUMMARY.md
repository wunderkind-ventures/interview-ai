# CORS Fix Summary

## Problem
You were getting CORS preflight errors when trying to call the BYOT API from your frontend:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://byot-gateway-1ntw604r.uc.gateway.dev/api/user/set-api-key' 
from origin 'http://localhost:9002' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause
The OpenAPI specification (`openapi-spec.yaml`) was missing explicit OPTIONS method definitions for each endpoint. While the Cloud Functions were setting CORS headers correctly, API Gateway was blocking OPTIONS preflight requests before they could reach the functions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated OpenAPI Specification**
Added OPTIONS methods for all endpoints in `backends/byot-go-backend/openapi-spec.yaml`:
- `/api/user/set-api-key` - OPTIONS method added
- `/api/user/remove-api-key` - OPTIONS method added
- `/api/user/api-key-status` - OPTIONS method added
- `/api/ai/genkit/{flowName}` - OPTIONS method added

Each OPTIONS method is configured to:
- Route to the same Cloud Function as the main method
- Return proper CORS headers in the response

### 2. **Updated Pulumi Deployment**
Modified `pulumi-gcp-byot-backend/main.go` to handle 16 placeholders instead of 8:
- 2 placeholders (URL + jwt_audience) for each OPTIONS method
- 2 placeholders (URL + jwt_audience) for each original method

### 3. **Other Fixes Applied**
- Fixed the BaseFlowInputType error in `generate-take-home-assignment.ts`
- Confirmed environment variable is properly set in `.env.local`

## Testing
Once deployment completes, you can:

1. **Open the test file**: Open `test-cors-fix.html` in your browser
2. **Run the tests**: Click "Run All Tests" to verify CORS is working
3. **Test in your app**: The settings page should now be able to save API keys without CORS errors

## Environment Setup
Make sure you have:
```bash
# In .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_GO_BACKEND_URL=https://byot-gateway-1ntw604r.uc.gateway.dev
```

## Next Steps
1. Wait for the Pulumi deployment to complete
2. Test using the `test-cors-fix.html` file
3. Try saving an API key in your settings page

The CORS issue should be completely resolved once the deployment finishes!
