# Prompt Optimization System - Python Implementation

This directory contains the Darwin-Gödel Machine Prompt Optimization (DGM-PO) system for offline prompt optimization.

## Overview

This system implements automated, self-improving prompt optimization using:
- **Evolutionary algorithms** for prompt mutation and selection
- **Reinforcement learning** for strategy optimization
- **Meta-learning** for continuous improvement
- **Empirical validation** through A/B testing
