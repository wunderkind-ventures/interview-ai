# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name
Darwin-Gödel-inspired Prompt Optimization (DGM-PO)

## Overview
The DGM-PO solution is an automated, self-improving prompt optimization system leveraging Darwin-Gödel Machine principles, meta-learning, and empirical validation to iteratively enhance prompt effectiveness in writing assessments and mock interview evaluations.

## Objectives
- Automatically optimize prompts for maximal rubric alignment.
- Continuously improve prompt strategies through empirical validation.
- Minimize human intervention while ensuring high-quality outcomes.
- Foster innovation and diversity in prompt-generation methods.

## User Segments
- Educational institutions conducting standardized writing assessments.
- Organizations implementing mock interviews for recruitment or employee development.
- AI and ML researchers exploring automated prompt optimization.

## Key Features

### 1. Prompt Generation Layer
- **Meta-Prompts:** High-level instructions for generating task-specific prompts.
- **Prompt Templates:** Customizable templates for various scenarios (e.g., STAR responses, reflective essays).

### 2. Mutation Engine
- Automated variations of prompts (style, structure, content).
- Systematic exploration of linguistic and instructional alterations.

### 3. Evaluator Engine
- AI-driven rubric-based scoring (e.g., GPT-4, Claude).
- Optional human-in-the-loop validation for qualitative assessments.

### 4. Diagnostic & Self-Improvement Engine
- AI-driven performance analysis to identify optimization opportunities.
- Automated recommendations for self-modification.
- Self-executing changes in meta-prompts, templates, or internal configurations.

### 5. DsPy Framework Integration
- Declarative modular pipelines for prompt structuring.
- Automatic optimization and configuration management.

### 6. Archive Repository
- Database of past prompt optimizers and strategies.
- Supports open-ended evolutionary innovation and retrospective analysis.

## Workflow
1. **Initial Selection:** Choose prompt optimization strategies from the archive.
2. **Generation & Mutation:** Create and evolve prompts dynamically.
3. **Execution:** Deploy prompts in writing assessments or mock interviews.
4. **Evaluation:** Automatically score outputs based on rubric alignment.
5. **Diagnosis:** Analyze performance logs via AI-driven diagnostics.
6. **Self-Modification:** Implement suggested improvements automatically.
7. **Validation:** Empirically validate modified strategies.
8. **Archive Management:** Update archive with improved strategies.

## Technical Specifications
- **Language & Tools:** Python, DsPy Framework, OpenAI/Gemini LLM APIs.
- **Storage & Database:** Relational DB for archives (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS/GCP (serverless deployment for scalability).
- **Security & Compliance:** GDPR, FERPA compliant for educational deployments.

## Success Metrics
- Increased rubric alignment scores.
- Reduction in manual prompt engineering effort.
- Enhanced diversity and adaptability of prompt strategies.
- Positive user feedback (quantitative & qualitative).

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** AI-driven inaccuracies or bias in evaluations.
  - **Mitigation:** Regular audits, human-in-the-loop validations, and bias monitoring.
- **Risk:** Overfitting to specific prompts or rubrics.
  - **Mitigation:** Continuous diversification of mutations and extensive empirical testing across diverse use-cases.

## Roadmap
### Phase 1: Initial Prototype (Completed)
