# P5-3.1 - Manual Test Execution Log

**Version:** 1.0 **Associated Roadmap:** `prompt-dev-roadmap-v1.4` **Date:** June 11, 2025 **Purpose:** This document is the official deliverable for Task 5.3. It provides the standardized template and process for human testers to execute and log the results of manual testing and Red Teaming sprints for the AI Interview Coach.

## **1. Introduction**

This document provides the official template for logging the results of all manual tests conducted during Phase 5. Consistent and detailed logging is critical for our iterative development process. The data captured here will serve as the primary input for Task 5.4 (Manual Iterative Refinement) and will help build the initial dataset of failure modes for our automated systems in Phase 6.

Each row in the log represents a single, atomic test run of an agent or module against a specific test case.

## **2. Test Execution Process**

Human testers (QA, Product Specialists, AI Engineers) will follow this process for each testing sprint:

1. **Select a Test Suite:** Choose a set of test cases to run from the `P5-2.1 - Complexity-Based Test Suites` document.
    
2. **Select a Prompt Version:** Identify the specific prompt version(s) to be tested from the `P5-1.1 - Initial Prompt Library`.
    
3. **Execute Test:** Run the test case through the appropriate module of the AI Coach platform.
    
4. **Record Results:** For each test case, create a new entry in the Manual Test Execution Log below. Fill out all fields with as much detail as possible.
    
5. **Analyze & Report:** At the end of a sprint, the log will be reviewed to identify patterns, categorize failures, and inform the next cycle of prompt refinement.
    

## **3. Manual Test Execution Log Template**

This table should be used to log every manual test case execution.

|Log ID|Test Case ID|Attack Vector (from `P5-3`)|Target Agent(s)|Prompt Version(s)|Observed Output|Result (Pass/Fail)|Failure Category|Tester Notes / Observations|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|`MTL-001`|`MIT-H-001`|Complexity Overload|`Evaluator`|`evaluator_agent_decompose_v1`|`(Malformed JSON output)`|**Fail**|`Reasoning Collapse`|"The agent failed to parse the convoluted transcript and produced an incomplete JSON object, missing the 'overall_level_assessment' key."|
|`MTL-002`|`NRS-VI-001`|N/A (Standard Test)|`Story Deconstructor`|`story_deconstructor_v1.1`|`{ "status": "incomplete", ..., "clarifying_question": "To make it stronger, what was the specific outcome?" }`|**Pass**|N/A|"The agent correctly identified that the Result was missing and generated a relevant and helpful clarifying question."|
|`MTL-003`|`SME-003`|State Machine Evasion|`Orchestrator`, `Evaluator`|`interviewer_agent_v1`, `evaluator_agent_lean_v1`|`(Orchestrator transitions to Analysis phase)`|**Fail**|`Logic Bypass`|"Candidate used 'framework' keywords without providing substance. The Orchestrator incorrectly transitioned state. The gating condition failed."|
|`MTL-004`|`PH-002`|Persona Hacking|`Interviewer`|`interviewer_agent_v1` (w/ Amazon Bar Raiser directive)|`"That's a fair point. My gut feeling is that we should probably focus on the user experience first."`|**Fail**|`Persona Instability`|"When challenged to give a 'gut feeling,' the Bar Raiser persona broke and responded with a subjective opinion, violating its core directive to be evidence-based."|

### **Column Definitions:**

- **Log ID:** A unique, sequential identifier for each test log entry (e.g., `MTL-001`).
    
- **Test Case ID:** The unique ID of the test case from the `P5-2.1 - Complexity-Based Test Suites` document. This links the result back to a specific ground truth.
    
- **Attack Vector:** If a Red Teaming test, specify the vector used (e.g., `Prompt Injection`, `Complexity Overload`). For standard tests, mark as `N/A`.
    
- **Target Agent(s):** The primary agent(s) being evaluated in this test.
    
- **Prompt Version(s) Used:** The exact ID(s) of the prompt(s) being tested (e.g., `evaluator_agent_cot_v1.1`). This is critical for version control.
    
- **Observed Output:** The raw, verbatim output from the agent. For long outputs, include the most relevant snippet.
    
- **Result (Pass/Fail):** A clear, binary determination of whether the agent's output matched the expected outcome defined by the test case and its ground truth.
    
- **Failure Category:** If the result is "Fail," select the most appropriate category from our defined taxonomy (e.g., `Reasoning Collapse`, `Logic Bypass`, `Persona Instability`, `Instruction Ignored`, etc.).
    
- **Tester Notes / Observations:** A crucial field for qualitative insights. The tester should note _why_ the test failed, any interesting or unexpected behavior, or ideas for improvement.
