##### Amazon General Job Level Guideline 

# **Overview**

The purpose of this guideline is to make sure Amazon job levels are consistently applied across all jobs, organizations, and geographies. This guideline, individual Role Guidelines, and our [Leadership Principles](https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles) are all foundational mechanisms that help us **calibrate** and maintain our high bar when hiring and promoting. Jobs with no guideline (or with out-of-date content) may use this guideline with the understanding that employee expectations vary to meet their customer and business-specific needs. No two Amazon teams are identical and each is encouraged to develop their own approach to delighting their customers. Leaders are expected to use their best judgment if the examples provided do not apply to their use cases.

# **Amazon Levels** 

Amazon uses job levels to differentiate role expectations and skill requirements for appropriate compensation. Our level structure is designed to reflect the development stages of employees as they begin their career, gain experience, grow their skills, take on more challenging projects, and become a **leader**[^1] (or a leader of leaders). 

Amazon levels fall into the following categories:

* **Individual Contributors** (ICs) – Employees that perform a job. ICs typically do not have direct reports. 

* **Business Management** – Managers of employees with work expectations that are more likely to be unstructured, ambiguous, complex, and high impact (e.g., business development, engineering, finance, HR, legal, product or program management, etc.). 

* **Operations Management** – Managers of employee populations with work expectations that are more likely to be structured, task-based/procedural, with more targeted workflow impacts (e.g., CS, Device Associates, ERC, FC, Data Center Ops, RBS, TRMS, etc.). 

# **Functional Dimensions**

Functional dimensions are high-level themes that are useful for level calibration. Functional dimensions are not additional Leadership Principles. As the foundation of our culture, Leadership Principles apply to every Amazonian at every level and are not restated in this guideline or in any Role Guideline.

* **Ambiguity**: The degree to which work expectations are defined and at what level it is reasonable to expect someone to use judgment, or create/design a solution, strategy, plan, framework, etc. It also clarifies how much supervision is required vs. to what degree an employee can deliver independently.   
* **Scope and Influence**: This dimension is the size of work and/or area of ownership for which an employee is responsible and the people influenced in that scope (e.g., peers, partner teams, vendors, leaders). Scope is specific to a **job[^2],** making it one of the most challenging dimensions to clarify. The examples **do not** apply to all roles. To calibrate a level accurately, scope also requires **Impact to be defined**[^3]. For other ways to scope a role, see [Appendix B](#scope-concepts).

* **Execution**: This dimension provides an example of how employee expectations (what they do to deliver for their customer) change as levels increase. Lower levels range from task-based to procedural. As levels increase, work shifts from **tactical**[^4] to **strategic[^5]**. The types of problems and opportunities that are reasonable for this role/level, as well as the types of trade-offs they make. As levels get higher, complexity increases, balanced by factors in the other dimensions. Complexity terms are aligned to level on the GLG and not meant to be mixed and matched with other levels. 

* **Impact**: This clarifies the effect the employee’s work has on their business or technology area, at that level. Impact is the blast radius[^6] of a job and is commensurate with level. Examples are for context. When defining this dimension, work groups provide details (e.g., customer experience, revenue, adoption, engagement, metrics, goals, etc.).

* **Suggested Experience**: This dimension is unique in that it shows what is needed for hiring. It is not based on tenure. Some levels or roles do not require specific certifications or experience. For levels with experience requirements, these are met via education (e.g., trade certification, licensure, college or advanced degree) or equivalent experience, which indicates the employee can be self-educated Include desired years of experience needed at hire. We use *suggested* experience because we trust managers to hire the right person for the role. 

There are three additional functional dimensions that are not included in this guideline because they are role-specific. These dimensions can be included in a Role Guideline.

* **Technical Complexity**: This dimension is included in **Tech**[^7] Role Guidelines to clarify the technical and/or scientific skills needed for each level (e.g., understands architectural and design principals, delivers artifacts, understands multiple scripting languages). Tech Role Guidelines also contain a **Tech bar**[^8]. Only roles designated at Technical in PeopleSoft use this dimension. Non-technical roles with expectations that are technical in nature put these expectations in Execution. Note, this dimension was recently added and is not reflected in the corresponding matrices; however, it will be included as part of 2022 content updates.    

* **Communication**: The crux of this dimension is the employee’s ability to communicate effectively (written and verbal) to people three levels above the employee’s level. The example list should include the primary document types this role is expected to produce. We break this across the levels because it prevents one document type from being associated with one level. Note, this dimension was recently added and is not reflected in the corresponding matrices; however, it will be included as part of 2022 content updates.    

* **Process Improvement**: This dimension highlights operational excellence practices and mitigates Day-2 risk. Each role has ways to create, improve (optimize, simplify, automate), or eliminate controls and procedures to reduce bureaucracy or bottlenecks that slow invention and delivery for customers. Note, this dimension was recently added and is not reflected in the corresponding matrices; however, it will be included as part of 2022 content updates. 


# **About the General Level Matrix for ICs and Managers**

The next three pages contain a Level Matrix for Individual Contributors, Business Managers, and Operations Managers. 

The descriptions are intentionally concise and are carefully articulated to provide a general example of how Amazon levels align to a certain type of work expectation and to make sure how they progress is clear. For easy reference, calibration definitions in footnotes are repeated for each matrix

**Important Notes**: 

* Examples given do not indicate whether an employee level is **Exempt/Non-Exempt**[^9]. This is determined by Amazon Compliance when job codes are created.  
* The matrix does not repeat expectations documented in previous levels (i.e., the abilities of higher levels inherit those of lower levels). This means a Principal or Sr. Manager has all of the capabilities described in Levels 1-7.

# **Appendix A: FAQ**

1. ## ***What if I have questions about role guidelines?***

If you have any questions about role guidelines, open a [SIM with GTM](https://issues.amazon.com/issues/create?template=bf6dee4d-3b22-49f0-82ba-92896e68312a). 

2. ## ***Who are the customers of the General Level Guideline?***

The General Level Guideline is intended for use by Compensation, Compliance, Immigration, GTM, and Legal as a reference to align new job titles to the Amazon level construct. It is also used by groups of role subject matter experts (SMEs) working to create or revise [Amazon Role Guidelines](https://ivy-help-center.talent.a2z.com/article/article-1568200618517-Gtmgg1nif) to ensure that when they document job expectations and technical/other skill requirements, the definitions align with Amazon levels for appropriate compensation. This guideline is also available to employees that do not have a specific guideline for their job.

3. ## ***How did we define the contents of this guideline?***

The expectations by level are a distillation of the following perspectives:

* Amazon Compensation, including the surveys that inform Amazon pay ranges (e.g., Mercer, Towers, Watson)  
* Amazon Compliance and Risk Programs  
* Amazon Immigration Programs  
* Amazon Legal (Employment)  
* Global Talent Management, including recommendations from the Span and Layers discussions with Steam  
* Role Guidelines created/revised in years 2015-2019, vetted at each level up to Steam  
* Vetting with HR partners, Principals, Sr. Principals, Distinguished Engineers, Directors, and VPs, and SVPs across Amazon businesses (to refine the content and make it Amazonian)

4. ## ***Are level expectations the Bar?***

Not on their own. The Amazon Bar is a broader set of concepts that include how the employee demonstrates:

* [Leadership Principles](https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles)  
* **Functional expectations by level**, with an understanding that responsibilities may vary based on the customer, business need, and/or employee super powers.  
* [Principal Tenets](https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Principal/Tenets) (applies to Principal, Sr. Principal, and Distinguished Engineer roles)

In the absence of a Role Guideline or when it is out of date, the General Level Guideline is useful for understanding the ambiguity, execution, and complexity that is reasonably expected from a particular level. The areas that it does not adequately address are **Scope**, **Impact**, and **Technical** skill. These require context about the role and may have some variability in expectations depending on the customer or business.

5. ## ***What does it mean to “Raise the Bar”?***

Raising the bar is part of our Hire and Develop the Best Leadership Principle. It means hiring and promoting the candidate who demonstrates they are the best person to perform that job. It can also mean hiring a candidate with a proficiency, or with super powers, in areas that bring more to the job. For example, a Program Manager (PM) may have the ability to construct SharePoint workflows or have advanced Excel skills. This is not a basic requirement of that job, however the candidate possesses skills that enable them to be more efficient or to make others more efficient. In this way they “raise the bar” on the role and are more likely to be better than 50% of the PMs in the organization. 

Another example is when an industry is evolving, which is happening constantly in technology. There may be a point when the minimum requirements for an SDE I should include some knowledge of Machine Learning or AWS products. Several years ago, this would have been an unreasonable expectation. Now these subjects are part of most standard Computer Science programs, which means (hypothetically) we could, as a company, decide to raise the bar on the SDE role and incorporate these requirements into that role’s expectations.

6. ***What is not raising the bar?*** 

This is when a manager isn’t calibrated and expects an employee to operate at a higher level (i.e., take on a role with a broader scope, higher impact, work on problems or efforts with more complexity, or operate in a more ambiguous environment) than their current level definition suggests they can handle. This is acceptable when the employee is working to demonstrate the next level and/or are stretching their skills. It is also acceptable when there is no one else available, as long as the manager arranges some form of support to ensure the employee is set up for success and able to deliver the intended results for customers. 

7. ## ***How does this guideline differ from a Role Guideline?***

The General Level Guideline is a simplified, high-level example of Amazon levels. A Role Guideline is more specific, answering the following questions about a job:

1. *What does this role (physically or mentally) **do** when they come to work?*  
2. *What are their primary responsibilities?*  
3. *Who are their customers?*  
4. *What do they deliver? How do they deliver it?*  
5. *What knowledge, skills, or education do they need to perform this work?*

Effective Role Guidelines strike the right balance between documenting what’s common to all (general wording can be too vague) and specific (examples can be taken too literally or may only be relevant in one organization). To reduce the perception that the only way to progress to senior levels is via the management track, we also now ask that the manager functions be documented in a separate guideline from Individual Contributors (ICs).  

8. ## ***7\. Are their tenets for role guidance?***

Yes. Here are the **Role Guideline Tenets** (unless you know better ones...)

* [Leadership Principles](https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles) are not restated in Role Guidelines. As the foundation of our culture, Leadership Principles are fundamental expectations of every Amazonian at any level. 

* Role Guidelines map to job codes that reflect the work. When a job has significantly different skill requirements and/or responsibilities, it warrants a separate guideline and separate job codes. 

* Role Guidelines are not specific to an organization or business. We document general responsibilities so that anyone in a role, at the same level, working in any organization, in any region can understand the basic set of work expectations that are viewed as essential to be successful.

* Role Guidelines are written to be **timeless**. Content should not be out-of-date by the end of the year it is published.

* Role Guidelines develop employees at the right pace and support them as they work to achieve higher levels. 

* Role Guidelines do not reflect a specific employee’s unique strengths, expertise, and/or super powers. 

* Role Guidelines are living documents that evolve with our high bar. We inspect them periodically to make sure they reflect current job expectations and forward-looking guidance.

# **Appendix B: Glossary**

The following terms are utilized in role guidelines to align, clarify, and distinguish important differences in level capabilities. As with any other company guideline or tenet, these are considered *living* definitions that are subject to change as we learn and grow. 

9. ## ***Ambiguity and Complexity Concepts***

These terms define the types of challenges expected at particular levels (i.e., has the right skill and expertise to handle them). Key calibration transitions are Level 4 (can be expected to operate without SOPs) and Level 6 (can be expected to handle *complex* problems).

* **Well-established** \- tasks or procedures that are clearly documented and have been in production/used for more than a year (i.e., predictable process paths with every step defined).

* **Well-defined \-** *what* to do and *how* to do the work is clear. If this term is used to describe project work, it means that the parameters and requirements of the project are clearly communicated**.**

* **Straightforward** \- problems/efforts with minimal visible risks or roadblocks. *What* to accomplish is clear (and does not appear to be complicated), but *how* to accomplish the work is not clear (the employee uses their knowledge and skill to figure that out).

* **Difficult** \- problems/efforts with visible risks or roadblocks. This requires employee skill to implement, mitigate risks and overcome roadblocks. It takes more work to deliver results because of the challenges involved.

* **Complex** \- problems/efforts with visible risks, roadblocks, and some *constraints*. The employee has to mitigate the risks, overcome the roadblocks, and design an appropriately simple solution that addresses the constraints. Often this requires them to make trade-offs that require expertise, high judgment, and (typically) some ability to influence others to reach consensus on the right solution.[^44]

* **Significantly complex** \- problems/efforts with visible and not-yet-visible risks, roadblocks, constraints, and most of them *conflict* with each other (i.e., resolution to one issue creates a conflict with the resolution another issue, multiplied by the number of issues present). Requires expertise to make the right trade-offs and design a solution that is appropriately simple (doesn’t add to the complexity already present). Due to the stakeholders involved (i.e., the people blocking or driving the constraint, senior leaders involved in decisions, etc.) achieving alignment on a design or implementation is much more challenging and the trade-offs made can have longer-term impacts.

10. ## ***Leadership Capability Concepts***

These terms define a key leadership and skill transition used for level calibration that occurs between Level 5 (*Tactical*), Level 6 (*Tactical* and *Strategic*), and Level 7 (*Strategic*):

* **Tactical** is when someone takes action(s) to achieve *current* goals. The employee can prioritize based on a limited time horizon. Actions may include executing a series of tasks, managing one or more projects (point-in-time endeavors), or making changes that solve an immediate need. The employee is capable of making short-term trade-offs (e.g., time vs. quality), but may not understand the long-term effects of their decisions. 

* **Strategic** is when someone takes action(s) to achieve *future* goals. An employee that is strategic is capable of defining a mission, vision, tenets, and long-term priorities. They can define a problem or opportunity and align stakeholders, leaders, and employees to their vision/solution. Implementation requires some level of judgement and expertise to make appropriate *short-term* vs. *long-term* tradeoffs (e.g., business opportunity vs. resources vs. sustainability) and, at our most senior levels, more serious trade-offs (e.g., innovation vs. cost vs. brand trust).

11. ## ***Scope Concepts*** {#scope-concepts}

The scope of a role is the typical size of work and influence for an employee in that job at a particular level. Scope is one of the key dimensions to help hiring managers, interviewers, and Bar Raisers **calibrate** to a bar and properly assess the candidate level. When defined correctly, managers are able to scope work to match the capability of an employee so they can be set up for success and, if motivated, work toward the next job level. 

Scope is relative to a job. This means it is not appropriate to assume that the scope of one role is the same as another. At Amazon, we currently have three types of scope concepts defined:

* [Type of Work Concepts](#type-of-work-concepts)  
* [Team and Organization Concepts](#team-and-organization-concepts)  
* [Technical and Builder Role Concepts](#technical-and-builder-role-concepts)


One way to determine the scope for a job level is to envision writing a COE. If one of the *Whys* is the employee at that level did not have the capability to handle the **size** (larger scope often comes with more complexity) of the customer or initiative, then the scope for that level is incorrectly defined. 

#### **Type of Work** **Concepts** {#type-of-work-concepts}

One method to define the scope of a role is the type of work performed. The following concepts apply to many roles at Amazon, however there may be others not yet listed. Type of Work concepts often need additional clarity about the size of the effort to differentiate levels.

* **Task** is a piece of work; a part of a procedure.

* **Procedure** is a series of tasks; an official way of doing something. Often referred to as a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Typically routine.

* **Process** is a group of tasks and procedures (manual and/or automated). Often used to describe employee, business, and system workflows.

* **Workflow** is a sequence of administrative, industrial, or technology or other set of processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion.

* **Project** is a point-in-time effort with an end date. A project is undertaken to create a specific result.

* **Program** is a group of related projects, sub-programs, and/or activities managed in a coordinated and ongoing way. Often used to identify and manage different goals for a single customer or market over a time horizon of several years.

* **Feature** is any functionality or cohesive set of functions that has value to a customer. 

* **Product** is any cohesive set of features or functionality offered to a customer/user. *Team*\-level examples include: tools, applications, services, etc. *Organization*\-level examples include: Prime Now, Alexa Shopping, EC2, S3, etc. 


Below is a scope example based on *Type of Work* concepts:

*Product Manager*

| Level 4 | Level 5 | Level 6 | Level 7 | Level 8 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| N/A | Small to mid-size features | Major features or product | Major product or suite of products | Major product or suite of products with large industry impact |

#### **Team and Organization Concepts** {#team-and-organization-concepts}

Another way to show how a role’s scope changes by level is to use team and organization concepts. On their own, these work for some roles, but for most they need to be combined with concepts. This is often the case for technical and scientific roles.

* **Team** is a group of people who work together to solve a particular problem or provide a customer solution. Typically a team reports to a supervisor, but there are cases where a team is virtual (members report to different managers). For role guidance consistency, Team is defined as fewer than 10 people (e.g., two-pizza team). If there are more, it could be clarified as a large team (e.g., more than 10 people, exceeding the size of a two-pizza team).

* **Organization** (Org) is a group of teams that together provide one or more product(s) or business function(s). Orgs vary in size, with *small* *orgs* led by a Sr. Manager or Director and *large* *orgs* typically led by a VP. Organization size and maturity does alter employee expectations. Specifically the way they need to operate, their impact, the degree (and level) of senior leader interaction, business/problem ambiguity, system/architecture complexity, and the types of goals they are expected to take on (e.g., sales, financial, OP1/OP2, Steam). Role guidance needs to specify if (and at what level) expectations require *small* organization influence (versus *large* or *cross-organization*) and make sure that the expectation aligns to the ambiguity and complexity concepts at the level. 

* **Department** is an HR data designation that aligns with a Cost Center (relates to company accounting). Orgs often have multiple departments, some of which can be quite large. For the same reasons as above, the size of the department can alter the way an employee needs to operate. Usage is not advised unless the role actually is scoped to support a department (e.g., Financial Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Scientist, etc.) and the size of the department, scope, and impact align with the ambiguity and complexity concepts at the level. 

* **Business Unit** is an HR data designation. Often a company entity, which can vary significantly in size (causing similar differences as the previous two concepts in how employees operate). Usage is not recommended unless the role leads or directly supports this type of entity (typically Level 8 or higher). 

* **Division** is a group of organizations. Divisions are very large, typically led by an SVP. Usage is not recommended unless the role leads or directly supports this type of entity (typically Level 8 or higher). 

* **Company** refers Amazon and its subsidiaries. This is one of the highest scope concepts for roles that operate internally, however for roles that focus on external customers the concept may be used when combined with qualifiers such as size (e.g., *small* company), industry impact (e.g., *Fortune 500* company), or maturity (e.g., startup). 

* **Industry** is the highest level scope concept. It applies to any industry our products are offered. This concept implies significant impact that may include brand trust and regulatory complexity.

Below are IC and manager scope examples based on *Team* and *Organization* concepts:

*Business Management Roles:*

| Level 4 | Level 5 | Level 6 | Level 7 | Level 8 | Level 10 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| N/A | Team  | Team | Multiple teams | Small organization | Large organization |

*Program Manager:*

| Level 4 | Level 5 | Level 6 | Level 7 | Level 8 | Level 10 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Team | Cross-team | Organization | Cross-organization | Company | Industry |

#### **Technical and Builder Role Concepts** {#technical-and-builder-role-concepts}

Most technical roles will need to use one of the following concepts to articulate how scope of work changes by level. These terms follow technical design concepts. On their own, they are inadequate to describe how a role operates, as a component may be used to solve an extremely difficult problem. These concepts are typically combined with *Organization Structure* concepts to clarify the degree of influence a role at a particular level is expected to have.

* **Component** is a building block that does not solve a customer or business problem on its own, but is part of a solution. For engineers this translates to a piece of technology with a clearly defined interface that is indivisible, has minimal internal dependencies, and deliverable (somewhat) independently. In role guidance the size of a component and/or the degree of difficulty is differentiated by level (with smaller and more straightforward implementations assigned to lower levels and larger, more complex component solutions assigned to higher levels). Component examples:

  * **In software**, a component is an independently executable portion of code/logical functionality (e.g., storage component, library, workflow action to validate input, etc.). 

  * **In devices**, a component might be a power supply, motherboard, or a display; each of which has sub-components (e.g., resistors, transistors, chips). 

  * **In a systems-of-systems infrastructure**, a component would be a single system (also sub-system) that on its own does not satisfy the entire workflow need.

  * A product feature can also be broken down into components (e.g., models, datasets, or other functionality that is not directly offered to a customer but impacts their experience).

* **Architecture** is how we put components and features together to delight customers or solve a business problem. Architecture *design* includes deciding what components to build, refactor, or deprecate. An architecture can range from the internal structure of a single service, application, or web page to a large number of interdependent technologies and hardware that make up a significant product (e.g., process a credit card, how to pipeline data for analysis, etc.) In role guidance the size of the architecture and span of ownership (e.g., team, multiple teams, organization, etc.) are typically combined to differentiate builder levels adequately. For example, a product architecture may be entirely owned by a single team or ownership may span multiple teams and even an organization. This changes the way a role operates to be successful, as larger product architecture work would require influencing and building consensus with more teams and at higher senior levels.

* **System** is a group of technologies with interdependencies that work together to form a business process, solve a problem, or link architectures that provide the functionality for a product or feature. Systems, like architectures have dependencies that require consideration when designing new functionality. This often requires influencing other engineering team owners and achieving consensus on the approach. It also requires most changes to be coordinated. Small systems require engineers to work across teams and larger systems across organizations, geographies, and even globally. This adds to scope and complexity and needs to be taken into account when leveling a role.

* **Systems-of-systems** is a collection of task-oriented or dedicated components and systems that pool their resources/capabilities to offer more functionality/performance. Defining, abstracting, modeling, and analyzing these problems is referred to as *Systems-of-Systems Engineering*.

Below are IC scope examples using *Technical* and *Builder* concepts (note the combination with other scope concepts):

*SDE:*

| Level 4 | Level 5 | Level 6 | Level 7 | Level 8 | Level 10 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Component | Feature | Team architecture | Small organization architecture | Large organization architecture (may have industry impact) | Large organization architecture (has industry impact) |

*Datacenter Infrastructure Engineer:*

| Level 4 | Level 5 | Level 6 | Level 7 | Level 8 | Level 10 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Component | System | Infrastructure architecture | Global infrastructure architecture | Global infrastructure architecture (may have industry impact) | Global infrastructure architecture (has industry impact) |

[^1]:  **Leader** in this context means the employee exemplifies our Leadership Principles and demonstrates excellence in their specific job function.

[^2]:  **Job** is way of saying *Role at a particular level* (e.g., Business Analyst I, Business Analyst II, etc.). Span and Layers is an example of management scope.

[^3]:  An employee may have a narrow scope with high impact and vice versa.

[^4]:  **Tactical** is when someone takes action(s) to achieve *current* goals. The employee can prioritize based on a limited time horizon. Actions may include executing a series of tasks, managing one or more projects, or making changes that solve an immediate need. The employee is capable of making short-term trade-offs (e.g., time vs. quality), but may not understand the long-term effects of their decisions. 

[^5]:  **Strategic** is when someone takes action(s) to achieve *future* goals. An employee that is strategic is capable of defining a mission, vision, tenets, and long-term priorities. They can define a problem or opportunity and align stakeholders, leaders, and employees to their vision/solution. Implementation requires some level of judgement and expertise to make appropriate *short-term* vs. *long-term* trade-offs (e.g., business opportunity vs. resources vs. sustainability) and, at our most senior levels, more serious trade-offs (e.g., innovation vs. cost vs. brand trust).

[^6]:  One way to define **Impact** is to imagine writing a COE for a *job*. What aspects of the business or our technologies are affected by a failure?

[^7]: 12. ##  ***Tech is an employee classification to identify jobs requiring employee skill in one or more STEM disciplines:***

[^8]:  A common misunderstanding is that the Tech bar is equivalent to SDE requirements (e.g., able to code). Each Tech role has its own set of skills (and even coder roles have differing bars). Tech bars inform Bar Raisers and interviewers so they ask the right questions and, based on answers, calibrate the candidate to the level that best aligns to their abilities. When promoting, it informs whether the employee is demonstrating next-level Tech skills. A Tech bar in a Role Guideline is considered a **minimum set of requirements** to deliver expectations successfully. Teams and organizations may have higher-bar expectations, but they may not hire and thereby lower the bar.

Specifically the way they need to execute, business/problem ambiguity, system/architecture complexity, types of goals (e.g., OP1/OP2, Steam), senior leader interaction/influence, etc. To accurately calibrate a level that uses org for Scope, consider the size and whether expectations included working *across orgs* to understand the effect on other dimensions. 

[^15]:  **Task** is a piece of work; a part of a procedure.

[^16]:  **Procedure** is a series of tasks; an official way of doing something. Often referred to as a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Typically routine.

[^19]:  **Force multipliers** are individuals who either possess attributes or deliver solutions that dramatically increase (hence, multiplies) the effectiveness of a group, giving them the ability to accomplish greater things.

The employee has to mitigate the risks, overcome the roadblocks, and design an appropriately simple solution that addresses the constraints.

For more detail, see the [Glossary](#heading=h.gjdgxs) in the appendix of this guideline.

[^23]:  **Significantly complex** describes problems/efforts with visible and not-yet-visible risks, roadblocks, constraints, and many *conflict* with each other (i.e., resolution of one issue creates a conflict with the resolution of another issue; multiplied by the number of issues).
