5.9. Bring Your Own Assessment (BYOA)

Purpose: Enable users to submit their own custom writing prompt and draft submission (e.g., for take-home assignments, essays, or application questions) and receive AI-powered feedback on writing quality, prompt alignment, and an estimated level (e.g., L3-L7 for technical/behavioral responses).

User Stories:
- As a user, I want to paste or upload a custom writing prompt and my draft response to receive actionable feedback.
- As a user, I want the AI to assess my submission for clarity, structure, relevance to the prompt, and overall writing quality.
- As a user, I want to know what level (e.g., L3, L5, L7) my submission demonstrates, with rationale.
- As a user, I want suggestions for improvement and, optionally, a sample answer or outline.
- As a user, I want to save, revisit, and track my BYOA submissions and feedback over time.

Key Features:

**1. Custom Prompt & Submission Input**
- UI for users to enter or upload a writing prompt and their draft submission.
- Support for text input and (optionally) file upload (.txt, .md).

**2. AI-Powered Feedback Generation**
- Analyze submission for:
  - Clarity, structure, and coherence
  - Relevance and completeness with respect to the prompt
  - Writing mechanics (grammar, tone, conciseness)
  - Depth, scope, and impact (for technical/behavioral prompts)
- Provide structured feedback (strengths, areas for improvement, actionable suggestions).

**3. Level Assessment**
- AI estimates the demonstrated level (e.g., L3-L7) based on rubric/calibration for the relevant role or prompt type.
- Rationale for the assigned level is included in the feedback.

**4. Sample Answer/Outline (Optional)**
- Option for the user to request a sample answer or outline for the same prompt.

**5. Submission History & Progress Tracking**
- Save and display a history of BYOA submissions and feedback for logged-in users.
- Allow users to revisit, compare, and track improvement over time.

**6. Export & Sharing**
- Downloadable feedback and sample answer.
- Option to share submission and feedback with mentors or peers.
